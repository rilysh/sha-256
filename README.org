** SHA-256
An implementation of SHA-224 and SHA-256 according to RFC-6234.

** Notice
This implementation is purely software based and no explicit hardware
instructions were used. Due to this, the performance heavily relies on
the CPU speed. Also, only little-endian CPUs either x86-64 or AArch64 are
supported. PowerPC CPUs (uses big-endian) and unsupported due to the padding
and byte conversion. Although it's possible to patch it up, only if you have
a PowerPC CPU to test later.
